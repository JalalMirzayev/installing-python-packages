# Using modules globally

If you want to use packages for your self you need to install your package with `pip install`. Then you can simply write `import my_package` and use all the functionallity from your package.

# Installing the package

Open the terminal in the root folder of the project and type `pip install .`. This line will look for the `setup.py` and afterwards install the package in you package registry.
